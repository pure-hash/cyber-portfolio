# Lab 1 – DNS Anomalies

## Overview
This lab focuses on detecting anomalies in DNS traffic that may indicate suspicious behavior, malware activity, or early signs of attacks.

## Objectives
- Analyze DNS logs for unusual patterns
- Identify potential exfiltration or malicious activity
- Create alerts for anomalous DNS behavior

## Tools Used
- SIEM (Splunk, ELK)
- Python or PowerShell scripts
- DNS log datasets

## Steps
1. Collect DNS log datasets from lab environment  
2. Analyze query patterns and frequency  
3. Identify anomalies such as unusual domains or repeated queries  
4. Create alerts in SIEM for detected anomalies  
5. Document findings

## Findings
- Anomalous DNS queries detected  
- Alerts successfully triggered for suspicious activity  
- Patterns documented for SOC review

## Skills Demonstrated
- Log analysis  
- Threat hunting with DNS data  
- Anomaly detection  
- Alert creation in SIEM

## File Structure
- **`/datasets`** – DNS log files used for the lab  
- **`/images`** – Screenshots of analysis, dashboards, or alerts  
- **`/scripts`** – Hunting scripts for parsing or detecting anomalies
