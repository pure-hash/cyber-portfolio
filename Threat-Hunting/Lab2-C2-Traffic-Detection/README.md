# Lab 2 – Command & Control (C2) Traffic Detection

## Overview
Identify potential C2 traffic in network logs to detect compromised hosts.

## Objectives
- Analyze network traffic for anomalies
- Detect suspicious host communication
- Document findings

## Tools Used
- SIEM software
- Network log datasets (PCAPs)
- Python or PowerShell scripts

## Steps
1. Collect network logs from `/datasets`
2. Analyze communication patterns
3. Identify suspicious hosts or domains
4. Document alerts and findings

## Findings
- C2 traffic detected
- Alerts configured
- Findings documented

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic analysis
- Threat hunting
- Alert configuration

## Folder Structure
- **`/datasets`** – Network logs or PCAPs  
- **`/images`** – Screenshots of analysis or dashboards  
- **`/scripts`** – Detection scripts
