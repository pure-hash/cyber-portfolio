# Lab 3 – Suspicious Log Patterns

## Overview
Analyze system and application logs to identify suspicious patterns indicating potential malicious activity.

## Objectives
- Correlate events across multiple logs
- Identify abnormal patterns or behavior
- Configure alerts

## Tools Used
- SIEM software
- System and application logs
- Python or PowerShell scripts

## Steps
1. Collect logs from multiple sources in `/datasets`
2. Analyze for anomalies (failed logins, unusual processes)
3. Document suspicious patterns
4. Create alerts in SIEM

## Findings
- Suspicious activity patterns identified
- Alerts configured
- Findings documented

## Skills Demonstrated
- Log correlation and analysis
- Threat hunting
- Alert creation

## Folder Structure
- **`/datasets`** – Logs from multiple sources  
- **`/images`** – Screenshots of analysis or dashboards  
- **`/scripts`** – Detection scripts
