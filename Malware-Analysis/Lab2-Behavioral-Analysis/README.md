# Lab 2 – Behavioral Analysis in a Sandbox

## Overview
Analyze malware behavior in a safe, isolated environment to observe runtime activity, including file, registry, and network changes.

## Objectives
- Execute malware safely in a sandbox
- Monitor behavior and system changes
- Document suspicious activity

## Tools Used
- Sandbox environment (Cuckoo, Virtual Machines)
- Process monitoring (Procmon, Task Manager)
- Network monitoring (Wireshark)
- Python or PowerShell scripts

## Steps
1. Set up an isolated sandbox environment
2. Execute malware sample from `/samples`
3. Observe file, registry, and network changes
4. Capture screenshots and logs
5. Document findings in a report

## Findings
- Malware created suspicious files or registry keys
- Network activity detected to unknown domains
- Behavior documented for SOC use

## Skills Demonstrated
- Safe malware execution
- Behavior monitoring and analysis
- Incident documentation

## Folder Structure
- **`/samples`** – Malware or benign test files  
- **`/images`** – Screenshots from sandbox execution  
- **`/scripts`** – Automation or monitoring scripts
