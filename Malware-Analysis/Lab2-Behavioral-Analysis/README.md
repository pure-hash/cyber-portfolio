# Lab 2 – Behavioral Analysis in Sandbox

## Overview
Analyze malware behavior in a sandbox to observe runtime activity.

## Objectives
- Execute malware in isolated environment
- Monitor file, registry, and network activity
- Document malicious behavior

## Tools Used
- Sandbox (Cuckoo, Any.Run)
- Monitoring tools

## Steps
1. Run executable in sandbox
2. Monitor behavior and logs
3. Identify network connections, file changes
4. Document IOCs

## Findings
- Malicious behaviors captured
- Indicators logged
- Network connections analyzed

## Skills Demonstrated
- Dynamic malware analysis
- Threat observation
- Reporting findings

## File Structure
- **/images**: Screenshots of sandbox behavior
- **/scripts**: Monitoring scripts
- **/samples**: Test malware files
