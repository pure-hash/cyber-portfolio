# Lab 1 – Static Analysis of Executable

## Overview
Perform static analysis on a Windows executable to identify characteristics without executing the file.

## Objectives
- Identify file metadata and hashes
- Analyze PE headers
- Detect suspicious indicators

## Tools Used
- PEStudio, VirusTotal
- Sandbox environment

## Steps
1. Hash the file
2. Examine PE headers and imports
3. Record suspicious patterns

## Findings
- Executable hash calculated
- Suspicious imports identified
- Analysis report created

## Skills Demonstrated
- Static malware analysis
- File inspection
- Reporting

## File Structure
- **/images**: Screenshots of static analysis
- **/scripts**: Hashing or analysis scripts
- **/samples**: Test or benign executables
