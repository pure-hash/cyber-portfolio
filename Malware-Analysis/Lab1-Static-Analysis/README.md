# Lab 1 – Static Analysis of a Windows Executable

## Overview
This lab focuses on analyzing executable files without running them to identify suspicious behavior and characteristics.

## Objectives
- Examine file headers, strings, and metadata
- Identify potential indicators of malware
- Document findings for threat intelligence

## Tools Used
- PE viewers (PEStudio, CFF Explorer)
- Strings analysis (Sysinternals Strings)
- Python or PowerShell scripts

## Steps
1. Collect the sample executable from `/samples`
2. Analyze headers, sections, and imports
3. Extract embedded strings and metadata
4. Document suspicious indicators
5. Summarize findings in a report

## Findings
- Suspicious imports or anomalies identified
- Embedded strings flagged as potential indicators
- Summary report created

## Skills Demonstrated
- Static malware analysis
- Metadata and string examination
- Threat documentation

## Folder Structure
- **`/samples`** – Executable or test files  
- **`/images`** – Screenshots of analysis results  
- **`/scripts`** – Automation or analysis scripts
