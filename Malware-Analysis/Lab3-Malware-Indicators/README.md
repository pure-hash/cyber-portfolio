# Lab 3 – Malware Indicators

## Overview
Identify and document malware indicators including hashes, IPs, domains, and suspicious behaviors.

## Objectives
- Extract IOCs from malware analysis
- Compile actionable threat intelligence
- Share findings for defensive use

## Tools Used
- Analysis tools (sandbox, static tools)
- SIEM for IOC ingestion

## Steps
1. Collect hashes, IPs, domains
2. Correlate behavior with threat intelligence
3. Document findings

## Findings
- IOC list created
- Behavioral patterns summarized
- Recommendations for SOC

## Skills Demonstrated
- Threat intelligence collection
- IOC extraction
- Reporting for defense

## File Structure
- [/images](images): Screenshots of IOC collection
- [/scripts](scripts): Automation scripts
- [/samples](samples): Optional test files
