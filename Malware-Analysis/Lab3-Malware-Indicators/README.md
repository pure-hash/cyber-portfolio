# Lab 3 – Identifying Malware Indicators

## Overview
Extract malware indicators such as hashes, IP addresses, domains, and suspicious behaviors for threat intelligence purposes.

## Objectives
- Collect indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Correlate indicators with threat intelligence
- Document findings for SOC analysis

## Tools Used
- Hashing tools (SHA256, MD5)
- Network logs or sandbox outputs
- Threat intelligence sources
- Python scripts

## Steps
1. Analyze malware samples from `/samples`
2. Extract hashes, IPs, domains, and other IOCs
3. Compare against known threat intelligence
4. Document findings with screenshots
5. Prepare a report

## Findings
- Malware IOCs identified and validated
- Correlation with threat intelligence performed
- Report created for SOC use

## Skills Demonstrated
- IOC extraction and validation
- Threat intelligence correlation
- Reporting and documentation

## Folder Structure
- **`/samples`** – Malware or benign test files  
- **`/images`** – Screenshots of findings  
- **`/scripts`** – Analysis and automation scripts
