# Lab 2 – Vulnerability Scan

## Overview
Perform vulnerability scans on systems and networks to identify potential security issues.

## Objectives
- Scan systems for known vulnerabilities
- Identify weak configurations
- Document findings for remediation

## Tools Used
- Nmap, OpenVAS, Nessus
- Python or Bash scripts for scanning
- Scan result datasets

## Steps
1. Perform vulnerability scans on systems in lab environment
2. Collect scan outputs into `/datasets`
3. Capture screenshots of scan results in `/images`
4. Analyze and summarize vulnerabilities

## Findings
- Vulnerabilities detected and categorized
- Potential impact evaluated
- Findings documented

## Skills Demonstrated
- Vulnerability scanning  
- Risk analysis  
- Reporting  

## Folder Structure
- **`/datasets`** – Scan outputs and logs  
- **`/images`** – Screenshots of scan results  
- **`/scripts`** – Scanning or automation scripts
