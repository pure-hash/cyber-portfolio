Honeynet Project
This section contains honeynet labs that demonstrate how to simulate, monitor, and analyze network attacks in a controlled environment. Each lab is self-contained with its own README, logs, images, and scripts.

🔹 Labs Included
Lab 1 – SSH Honeypot
Simulate an SSH service to monitor unauthorized login attempts and log attacker behavior.
Located in Lab1-SSH-Honeypot/

Lab 2 – HTTP Honeypot
Simulate vulnerable web services to attract attacks and analyze malicious requests.
Located in Lab2-HTTP-Honeypot/

Lab 3 – Custom Python Honeypot
A low-interaction Python honeypot to demonstrate logging of arbitrary network connections.
Located in Lab3-Custom-Python-Honeypot/

🔹 Skills Demonstrated
Honeypot deployment and configuration
Network traffic monitoring
Log collection and analysis
Basic Python scripting for network services
Attack pattern observation and reporting

🔹 Folder Structure
Each lab folder contains:

/logs – Captured attack logs or monitoring data
/images – Screenshots of honeypot activity or dashboards
/scripts – Setup or automation scripts for the honeypot
README.md – Detailed instructions, steps, and findings

Each lab is self-contained, making it easy to review or share independently.
