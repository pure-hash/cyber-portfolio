# Honeynet Project

This section contains honeynet labs that demonstrate how to simulate, monitor, and analyze network attacks in a controlled environment. Each lab is self-contained with its own README, logs, images, and scripts.

## 🔹 Labs Included

- **Lab 1 – SSH Honeypot**  
  Simulate an SSH service to monitor unauthorized login attempts and log attacker behavior.  
  Located in `Lab1-SSH-Honeypot/`

- **Lab 2 – HTTP Honeypot**  
  Simulate vulnerable web services to attract attacks and analyze malicious requests.  
  Located in `Lab2-HTTP-Honeypot/`

- **Lab 3 – Custom Python Honeypot**  
  A low-interaction Python honeypot to demonstrate logging of arbitrary network connections.  
  Located in `Lab3-Custom-Python-Honeypot/`

- **Lab 4 – Geo-Mapping & Dashboard**  
  Parse attacker IPs from honeypot logs and visualize attack patterns on a world map.  
  Includes dashboard screenshots, heatmaps, and analysis.  
  Located in `Lab4-Geo-Mapping-and-Dashboard/`
