# Lab 1 – SSH Honeypot

## Overview
Set up an SSH honeypot to monitor unauthorized login attempts and capture attacker behavior in a controlled environment.

## Objectives
- Simulate an SSH server
- Log connection attempts (IP, username, password)
- Capture attacker commands for analysis

## Tools Used
- Python
- SSH libraries or socket programming
- Logging to file

## Steps
1. Run the honeypot script in `/scripts`
2. Monitor connections and commands in `/logs`
3. Take screenshots or record analysis in `/images`
4. Document attack patterns and findings

## Findings
- Recorded IP addresses attempting to connect
- Common usernames and passwords used
- Commands executed by attackers

## Skills Demonstrated
- Honeypot deployment  
- Network monitoring  
- Log analysis  

## Folder Structure
- **`/logs`** – Captured connection logs  
- **`/images`** – Screenshots of attacks or analysis  
- **`/scripts`** – Honeypot scripts and setup
