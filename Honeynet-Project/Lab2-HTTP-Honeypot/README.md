# Lab 2 – HTTP Honeypot

## Overview
Simulate vulnerable web services to attract attacks and capture HTTP requests and payloads.

## Objectives
- Run a fake web server
- Log HTTP requests and suspicious payloads
- Analyze attack patterns

## Tools Used
- Python + Flask
- Logging libraries
- Fake login pages or endpoints

## Steps
1. Run the HTTP honeypot script in `/scripts`
2. Collect request logs in `/logs`
3. Take screenshots of activity in `/images`
4. Analyze attack types and sources

## Findings
- Common paths and endpoints targeted
- Payloads submitted in POST requests
- Source IP addresses and attack frequency

## Skills Demonstrated
- HTTP honeypot setup  
- Logging and monitoring  
- Attack pattern analysis  

## Folder Structure
- **`/logs`** – Captured HTTP requests  
- **`/images`** – Screenshots of activity  
- **`/scripts`** – Honeypot scripts and setup
