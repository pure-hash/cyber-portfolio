# Lab 4 – Geo-Mapping & Dashboard

## Overview
Visualize attacker IPs from honeypot logs on a world map and analyze attack patterns.

## Objectives
- Parse IPs from previous honeypot logs
- Map attacker locations using GeoIP
- Generate dashboards with heatmaps and charts

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, folium, matplotlib, geoip2)
- GeoLite2 database

## Steps
1. Place honeypot logs from Labs 1–3 into `/logs`
2. Run the dashboard script in `/scripts`
3. Open `dashboard.html` to view the world map
4. Save screenshots in `/images`
5. Analyze patterns and record findings

## Findings
- Attack frequency per country
- Top attacker IPs
- Timeline of attacks

## Skills Demonstrated
- Log parsing  
- Geo-location mapping  
- Data visualization  

## Folder Structure
- **`/logs`** – Honeypot logs (IPs, timestamps)  
- **`/images`** – Screenshots of maps and charts  
- **`/scripts`** – Dashboard and parsing scripts
